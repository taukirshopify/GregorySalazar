Our parents showed us the value of hustling and how a hard work ethic can lead to success, especially in the face of adversity. We met in NYC and bonded over our cultural pride and in overindulging in Asian cuisines, all of which led to the birth of WE ARE CHIMMI.<\/p>\n            <p style=\"margin: 12px 0;\"> WE ARE CHIMMI, short for \"We Are Children of Immigrants,\" is a community building platform that celebrates the immigrant hustle.
